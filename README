OpenNeo ID
==========

A centralized login system built on Rails and Devise that serves as a hub for
multiple OpenNeo applications.

The basic flow is simple:

1. User accesses an OpenNeo app such as Dress to Impress.
2. User clicks "Log in" on the remote app.
3. User is redirected to OpenNeo ID with a token assigned by the remote app.
3. User logs in on OpenNeo ID.
4. OpenNeo ID sends a callback to the remote app including the user's data, the
   token from step 2, and a signature based on a secret token
   (set in config/openneo_auth.yml) to prevent forgery.
5. User is redirected to remote app, which will acknowledge the user as logged
   in based on the data received in step 4.

This new Rails version of OpenNeo ID is more fully-featured than the previous,
hackish system. It offers password resets, the ability to change account
settings, and the ability to log in to multiple applications in one session
without having to type in the username and password for a second time.

Fun stuff.

To the hackers of the world
---------------------------

Users are specifically instructed not to use their Neopets or e-mail passwords
here. Passwords are strongly hashed and salted. If you find a security issue,
please let me know at webmaster % openneo ! net, since security is very
important to me; however, if you're just looking for easy money or Neopoints,
this is not the place to look.
